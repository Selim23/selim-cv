                        <p className="px-12 text-2xl py-12 text-white">"Hi! My name is Selim. Iâ€™m 23 and I live in Antwerpen but I'm born in another country - Turkey, Elazig-Karakocan, where I lived for 10 years. In 2008, my dad decided to change his job, and we all moved to Antwerpen. I have also a sister and a brother.
my father has his own business. He makes Turkish dishes and desserts.  He has a bakery where I had to work a lot during my studies.<br/><br/>

As a child, I found computers fascinating. Everything you could do with it was like magic.
We had a computer at home for the first time in 2004. it was a windows 98. I was then day and night behind my pc playing games and everything.  That's how I discovered my interest in computers.<br/><br/>  After we moved to Antwerp, I had a language delay in the beginning, which took 2 years from my school years.  I had to redo 2 times in a row year because my language was not enough.  that's why I didn't have that many choices in high school.  I have decided to follow electricity.  after finishing my studies in high school, I decided to try programming in college. I tried 1-year bachelor of ICT electronics and then switched to graduate programming.
